        <li>
            <strong>push -u origin master</strong> - this will set it so it pushes to the master branch, and afterwards

        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8600; Feature Commit 1 &rarr;

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Master branch</strong> - Commit 1 / Commit 2 / etc...
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Feature branch</strong> - feature commit 1 / feature commit 2 / etc...
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Hotfix branch</strong> - Hotfix Commit / etc..
        </li>
    </ul>
    A feature branch is usefull to test out different outcomes without changing the master branch (or main) <br>
    Eventually you have to merge it back to the main when you are done with your feature or hotfix. <br>
    But this is very usefull to use without screwing up your main project.
    </p>

    <h2>Git commands 1.1</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>git branch</strong> - This is to check which branch you are currently in and which branches there
            currently are, when there are muliple ones
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>git checkout</strong> - this is used to switch between branches
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>git checkout -b</strong> - this is used to make a new branch (feature-moving-image; example)
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>git branch -d</strong> - this is used to delete your branchname
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>git diff</strong> - this is used to see the changes that are made between files/ branches
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>git merge</strong> - this is used to merge with the main/master branch again
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>git push -u origin</strong> - This is used to add the new branch to your github repository
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>git pull</strong> - this is used to get the updated version from github when someone made changes
            and you dont have them yet
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>pull request</strong> - this is used on Github to merge is with the main or master branch <br>
            inside this pull request you are able to add more comments on why you did something
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Extra Info</h2>
    <p>
        If you dont have an upstream yet then you should use <strong>git pull -u origin</strong> branchname
    </p>
    <p>
        Don't reuse branches that you already have used <br>
        If you've used one branch then you should remove the old branch with <strong>git branch -d</strong> branchname
        and afterwards create a new one for a next feature or hotfix
    </p>
    <p>
        When a file is status : <strong>modified</strong> then you coud use a shortcut command <br>
        <strong>git commit -am</strong> "then add message here"
    </p>
    <p>
        But when a file is newly created then you have to use <strong>git add</strong> first
        and <strong>git commit -m</strong> "message" to let it know <br>
        After you have done this you are able to use the shortcut <strong>git commit -am</strong>
        when the status says its modified again (this saves time)
    </p>
    <p>
        Locally merge is used to update your feature branch with the master <strong>(Command line)</strong><br>
        This is mainly used when you are working on a project and other people made a change and
        pushed it to the master and you dont have the updated version yet
    </p>

    <h2>Git Commands 1.2</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>git reset</strong> - to reset all of staged files
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>git reset *filename*</strong> - to reset the current staged filename <br>
            example;
            <strong>git status</strong> <br>
            staged files :
            <ul>
                <li>README.md</li>
                <li>index.html</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>git reset index.html</strong> <br>
            This will remove the index.html from staging <br>
            <strong>git status</strong> <br>
            staged files :
            <ul>
                <li>README.md</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>git reset HEAD</strong> - undo the last commit you did
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>git reset HEAD~1</strong> - undo the commit before your last commit
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>git log</strong> - is a log that shows all of your commits you did <br>
            this is also displayed from latest to first <br>
            example; <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    commit - hashcode <br>
                    Merge : if its merged <br>
                    Author : Who did the commit <br>
                    Date : Fri Feb 05 timestamp 2021 -somecode <br><br>
                    your commit message
                    <hr>
                </li>
                <li>
                    commit - hashcode <br>
                    Author : Who did the commit <br>
                    Date : Fri Feb 03 timestamp 2021 -somecode <br><br>
                    your commit message
                    <hr>
                </li>
                <li>
                    commit - hashcode <br>
                    Author : Who did the commit <br>
                    Date : Fri Feb 02 timestamp 2021 -somecode <br><br>
                    your commit message
                    <hr>
                </li>
                <li>
                    commit - hashcode <br>
                    Author : Who did the commit <br>
                    Date : Fri Feb 01 timestamp 2021 -somecode <br><br>
                    your commit message etc etc..
                    <hr>
                </li>
            </ul>
            So if you want to return to a specific commit you could copy one of those specific hash codes <br>
            This could be used when you did something and its not working good and you want to have the previous
            working version
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>git reset --hard</strong> - <strong>BE CAREFULL!</strong> this is a hard reset
            Where you delete all your previous commits and return to the specific hashcoded commit
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Extra Info</h2>
    <p>
        Want to change things to a specific Github repository then you should use the fork symbol on Github <br>
        What this does ? <br>
        It basicly gives you a copy of that Github repository <br>
        BUT its under your name and you are the owner <br>
        So then you could change the code without screwing everyone over when you've made a change
    </p>
